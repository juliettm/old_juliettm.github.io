Topic modeling is way of identifying patterns (topics) in a collection of documents. 

This is only a proof of concept to check out the performance of the LDA algorithm at MLlib based on the posts:

* [Topic modeling with LDA: MLlib meets GraphX](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/03/25/topic-modeling-with-lda-mllib-meets-graphx.html)
* [Large Scale Topic Modeling: Improvements to LDA on Apache Spark](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/09/22/large-scale-topic-modeling-improvements-to-lda-on-apache-spark.html)

## Data 

The text used to this proof was extracted from the BBC Mundo web page using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a Python library for web scrapping. The code used is available in the [BBC scraping](https://github.com/juliettm/scrapy/blob/master/bbc_scraping.ipynb) iPython notebook.

## Proof of concept

I've use the [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) environment to run the experimentation. This is a very useful tool that provides built-in [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) integration.

All the original code can be viewed in this [Zeppelin notebook](https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer/notebooks/bm90ZTovL2p1bGlldHRtL0xvY2FsLVplcC81M2Q0MTY3YWYxNjA0ZTc2YmZlM2EzOGM3ODFkZGRiNy9ub3RlLmpzb24). Also this [Updated notebook](https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer/notebooks/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2p1bGlldHRtL1plcHBlbGluTm90ZWJvb2tzL21hc3Rlci8yQ0JXR1pCNlYvbm90ZS5qc29u) uses the LDA version included in the MLlib DataFrame based API.
