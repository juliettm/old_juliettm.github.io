A cohort is a group of subjects who share a common characteristic over a certain period of time. 

Cohort analysis allows keep on track some aspects of interest in business. Cohort analisis groups people by some characteristic in common and follow the behavior of the groups in time. 

The common characteristic of the group could vary depending on the objective of the cohort analysis and the period could be any time agregation necesary to measure the value of interest. There is many alternatives to make cohort analysis, could be useful to make channel acquisition analysis, to predict lifetime value, in this case let's visualize an user retention example.

## Example: User retention
There are different definitions of retention but let's define the user retention for an app as the percentage of users who come back and perform any action in the app "N" days after they start using it. 

The cohort group will be defined by the date in which the user download the app: each group "contains" all new users that download the app each day. The cohort period will be the days after the download. The Day 1 retention will be 100% for all groups no matter how many users download the app and the subsequents days retention will be the percentage of the users who come back and perform any action in the app. This view shows how much the users are interacting with the app.

## Python 

A total of 13 days will be considered for the example. The cohort groups involves the users that has been downloaded the app each day and the cohort period will be the days after the download.

```python
# Number of days to track
n = 13 
# Dates of download (Cohort Groups)
dates = pd.date_range('20161001',periods=n).map(lambda x: x.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
# Study days (Cohort Period) 
days = ["Day "+ str(d) for d in list(range(1,n+1))]
```

The analysis will consider the percent of the users that keep using the app each day after the download.

```python
# Generate the data for analysis
data = []
for i in range(n,0,-1):
    # Generate values between 1 and 1000
    val = random.sample(range(1, 1000), i) 
    # Sort values and reverse the order 
    sorted_val = sorted(val)[::-1] 
    # Divide the data by the higher value
    # This is the number of users that download the app (day one)
    data += [[round(val/float(sorted_val[0]),3) for val in sorted_val]]
# Create a data frame with the generated data
retention = pd.DataFrame(data,index=dates,columns=days)
retention.index.name ='Cohort Group'
retention.columns.name = 'Cohort Period'
```

[Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python library which provides a [heatmap](http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) visualization that makes possible a beautiful cohort analysis design.

```python
# Seaborn heatmap
sns.set(style='white')
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plt.title('Cohorts: User Retention')
sns.heatmap(retention, annot=True, fmt='.0%')
```
The figure shows the result, the color scale shows how is decreasing the use of the app after the download day. The company could take actions, based on the data, to improve the engagement with the app.
